## ðŸ“„ Project Description

**FightSquad** is a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) application that lets users manage MMA-style teams using a clear and interactive graphical interface.
The project was created as part of a school assignment. It builds on an earlier assignment where the data was hardcoded, and now allows users to create, edit, and manage teams and their members through a dynamic and user-friendly system with proper input validation and a clean code structure.
